# Priority-Queue

This project involves the implementation of a priority queue abstraction class for managing elements with integer priorities. The priority queue is designed to handle situations where elements with the same priority may be added, requiring a customized approach for breaking ties. The underlying data structure used for this priority queue is a custom binary search tree (BST), with nodes storing both priority values and templated values. Special attention is given to handling duplicate priorities, creating linked lists within the BST to manage elements with the same priority. The implementation includes functions for enqueuing, dequeuing, and accessing elements based on priority, with a focus on preserving the order of insertion for elements with the same priority.
